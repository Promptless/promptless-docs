# User Settings and Notifications

After creating your first project in Promptless, it's important to configure your user settings and notification preferences to ensure you're receiving updates in the most effective way for your workflow.

## Accessing User Settings

You can access your user settings through the User Settings tab in the Promptless dashboard.

## Notification Preferences

### Slack Notifications
- **Notification Channel**: Configure a specific Slack channel where Promptless will send all documentation update suggestions
- **Channel Selection**: Choose between existing channels or create a new one dedicated to Promptless notifications

### GitHub PR Notifications
- **PR Comments**: Configure whether Promptless should leave comments on GitHub Pull Requests when:
  - Documentation updates are needed
  - No documentation updates are required
- This helps keep your development team informed about documentation status directly within their workflow

## Best Practices

We recommend configuring your notification preferences immediately after creating your first project. This ensures that:
1. You'll receive all relevant documentation suggestions in your preferred channel
2. Your development team stays informed about documentation requirements
3. You can maintain a clear overview of Promptless's documentation activities
