Promptless utilizes a secure, modern network architecture designed for reliability, security, and scalability. Our infrastructure is built on industry-leading cloud platforms with multiple layers of security controls and redundancy.

## Infrastructure Overview

[Diagram to be added: High-level network architecture diagram showing key components and security layers]

Our infrastructure is designed with the following key principles:
- Security by design at every layer
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Scalability and performance optimization
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

## Security Architecture

### Network Security Measures

#### Perimeter Security
- Enterprise-grade firewall protection with intelligent threat detection
- Advanced DDoS protection and mitigation
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) for application-layer protection
- Regular security scans and vulnerability assessments

#### Network Segmentation
- Strict network segregation between components
- Micro-segmentation for enhanced security control
- Private networking for sensitive operations
- Network access control lists (NACLs) and security groups

#### Traffic Management
- Load balancing with SSL/TLS termination
- Traffic encryption between all services
- Rate limiting and request throttling
- Automated traffic analysis and anomaly detection

### Infrastructure Security

#### Cloud Infrastructure
- Deployment across multiple availability zones
- Automated failover and disaster recovery
- Regular security patches and updates
- Immutable infrastructure practices

#### Monitoring and Alerting
- 24/7 infrastructure monitoring
- Real-time security event detection
- Automated incident response procedures
- Performance and availability monitoring

#### Backup and Recovery
