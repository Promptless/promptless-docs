# Network Architecture

Promptless utilizes a secure, modern cloud-based network architecture designed for reliability, security, and scalability. Our infrastructure is built on industry-leading cloud platforms with multiple layers of security controls and redundancy.

## Infrastructure Overview

<img src="/img/simplified_network_architecture.png" alt="Simplified Network Architecture" style={{width:"800px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto", boxShadow: "0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", marginBottom: "20px"}} />


Our infrastructure is designed with the following key principles:
- Security by design at every layer
- High availability and fault tolerance
- Scalability and performance optimization
- Comprehensive monitoring and observability

## Key Security Measures

While we can't highlight all of Promptless's security measures here, we've highlighted some of the key ones below:
* Data encryption in transit: All data at rest is encrypted using TLS 1.2 or later.
* Data encryption at rest: Data stored in Promptless's database is encrypted with AES-256.
* Data access controls: We use a combination of access controls, including role-based access control (RBAC), to ensure that only authorized users have access to sensitive data.
* Principle of least privilege: We only give users the minimum permissions they need for their role.
* Logical separation of data: All data is tagged with customer identifiers, to ensure multiple layers of logical separation between Promptless users
