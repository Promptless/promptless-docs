### Apr 7, 2025

**What's New:**

* **Slack Image Support:** You can now add screenshots to your docs directly from Slack. Just trigger Promptless on Slack messages with screenshots or images, and it will automatically place them in the right spot in your docs. For example, if you notify a customer about a new feature in a Slack Connect channel and include screenshots and trigger Promptless via the Slack Message Action, Promptless will be able to include those screenshots in the documentation when appropriate. 

* **Slack Thread Link Processing:** Promptless now properly handles links to Slack threads in messages. When you share a Slack thread link in a message where Promptless is triggered, it will automatically retrieve and analyze the content of that thread for documentation updates. This makes it easier to reference valuable conversations without having to trigger Promptless in the original thread.

* **Directory-Specific Triggers:** Set up automatic documentation updates from specific directories in your repos (like your changelog directory). We'll update your docs whenever changes are made in these directories. For example, if you have a changelog directory, you can have Promptless be triggered whenever there is a Pull Request that includes updates to it. 
 
* **File Management:** You can now rename new documentation files or move them to different folders from the Promptless app. For example, after Promptless creates a new tutorial page, you can easily move it from the general docs folder to your dedicated tutorials section without leaving the interface.

* **Changelog Publishing:** Promptless now automatically creates changelog entries when new features are shipped. If your docs already have a changelog structure, Promptless will update it appropriately. 

* **Custom Instructions:** You can contact the Promptless team (either via Slack or at help@gopromptless.ai) to add custom instructions for how your docs should be generated. *Example: Specify that all code examples should use TypeScript instead of JavaScript, or that certain terminology should always be used consistently across your documentation.*

**Bug Fixes:**

* **GitHub Comments:** GitHub comments that are unrelated to documentation will no longer trigger Promptless to generate new commits.

**Integrations:**

* **Webflow Support:** Connect to your docs hosted on Webflow.
* **BitBucket Support:** Trigger Promptless doc updates from BitBucket pull requests.
