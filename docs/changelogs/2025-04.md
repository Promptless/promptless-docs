**What's New:**

* **Slack Image Support:** You can now add screenshots to your docs directly from Slack. Just trigger Promptless on Slack messages with screenshots or images, and it will automatically place them in the right spot in your docs.
* **Directory-Specific Triggers:** Set up automatic documentation updates from specific directories in your repos (like your changelog directory). We'll update your docs whenever changes are made in these directories.
* **File Management:** You can now rename new documentation files or move them to different folders from the UI.
* **Auto Changelogs:** Promptless now automatically creates changelog entries when new features are shipped.
* **Custom Instructions:** You can contact the Promptless team to add custom instructions for how your docs should be generated.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **GitHub Comments:** GitHub comments that are unrelated to documentation will no longer trigger Promptless to generate new commits.

**Integrations:**

* **Webflow Support:** Connect to your docs hosted on Webflow.
* **BitBucket Support:** Trigger Promptless doc updates from BitBucket pull requests.
