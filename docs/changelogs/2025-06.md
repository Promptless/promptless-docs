## New Features

### Replay Recent PRs/MRs on Project Setup

When setting up a new GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab project, you can now choose to have Promptless analyze recent pull requests or merge requests from the past 1-30 days. This "replay" feature helps you catch up on documentation for changes that occurred before Promptless was configured.

**How it works:**
- Enable the "Replay Pull Requests from the last N days" option when creating a new project
- Choose between 1-30 days to look back for recent PRs/MRs
- Promptless automatically analyzes these recent changes and suggests documentation updates as needed
- Works with all supported repository platforms (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab)
- Respects your project's directory-specific trigger settings

This feature is particularly useful for teams adding Promptless to existing projects with active development.
