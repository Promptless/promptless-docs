**What's New:**

* **Zendesk Trigger Support:** You can now trigger Promptless from Zendesk support tickets. When a ticket is marked as "Solved" or when you tag @Promptless in a comment, Promptless will analyze the conversation for potential documentation updates. This helps transform common support questions into improved documentation, reducing repeat tickets and enhancing self-service options for your customers.
