### May 29, 2025

**What's New:**

* **Jira Integration:** Added Jira as a context source integration, allowing Promptless to retrieve and search Jira issues when generating documentation updates. This includes OAuth 2.0 authentication, issue retrieval by key, and JQL search capabilities to ensure documentation updates are informed by actual project management context.

* **Webflow Publishing:** Enhanced Webflow integration with direct publishing from the Change History page. Added "Save All & Publish to Webflow" button for seamless content publishing, automatic item management, and support for multiple Webflow collections.

* **Per-File Publishing for ReadMe:** Added capability to publish individual files to ReadMe instead of requiring all files to be published at once, providing more granular control over documentation updates.

* **Enhanced Slack Integration:** Promptless now responds directly in Slack threads instead of sending private ephemeral messages, improving transparency and collaboration. Added automatic channel joining capability for public channels when mentioned.

* **Improved Suggestions UI:** Redesigned the Change History page with a new card-based UI, improved filtering and sorting options, enhanced status display, and better visualization of trigger events.
