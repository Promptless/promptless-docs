### May 2, 2025

**What's New:**

* **Enhanced Webflow Integration:** We've expanded our Webflow support with full publishing capabilities. You can now connect Promptless to your Webflow sites and automatically update content across multiple collections simultaneously. This makes it easier to maintain documentation that spans different content types or sections in your Webflow site.

**Improvements:**

* **Multiple Collection Support:** When setting up Webflow projects, you can now select multiple collections to publish to within a single documentation pipeline. Promptless will intelligently route content to the appropriate collection based on your documentation structure.

* **Preprocessing Notifications:** Added internal notifications for documentation preprocessing status, improving visibility into the indexing process for new documentation repositories.
