## New Features

### Enhanced Bitbucket Publishing Workflow
- **Direct Publishing**: Added "Save All & Update Bitbucket" button in the Change History page for seamless documentation repository updates
- **Automatic Commit Management**: Support for both direct commits and pull request creation for documentation changes
- **Branch Strategy Configuration**: Enhanced branch management with options for main branch commits or feature branch creation
- **Real-time Feedback**: Publishing progress indicators and success/error messaging for better user experience

This enhancement makes the Bitbucket integration more practical for day-to-day documentation workflows by enabling direct publishing to documentation repositories without manual intervention.
