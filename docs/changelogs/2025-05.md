**What's New:**

* **Bitbucket Replay Recent PRs:** You can now replay multiple recent Bitbucket pull requests at once. This feature allows you to process a backlog of PRs or catch up on documentation for repositories that were recently added to Promptless. Simply select a repository, specify how many recent PRs to process (up to 50), and Promptless will automatically analyze each PR for potential documentation updates.
