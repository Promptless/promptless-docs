### May 20, 2025

**What's New:**

* **Improved Suggestions UI:** We've redesigned the suggestions table in the Change History page to provide a clearer view of your documentation updates. The new UI shows each suggestion with its title, description, affected files, and associated trigger events, making it easier to track how documentation changes are connected to specific events in your development workflow.

* **Multiple Trigger Events Support:** Suggestions can now be associated with multiple trigger events. For example, a single documentation update might be triggered by both a GitHub pull request and a follow-up Slack conversation, giving you better context for each documentation change.

* **Clickable Trigger Events:** Trigger events in the Change History page now include direct links to their original sources. You can click on a trigger event to navigate directly to the GitHub pull request, Slack message, Zendesk ticket, or other source that initiated the documentation update.

**Bug Fixes:**

* **PR Comments:** Fixed an issue where "no suggestions" comments weren't consistently shown on GitHub and Bitbucket pull requests when no documentation updates were needed. Now, users will always receive feedback on their pull requests, whether or not documentation changes are required.

**Documentation Updates:**

* Added a new guide on [Managing Documentation Suggestions](/using-promptless/suggestions) that explains how to review, edit, and publish documentation suggestions in the Promptless dashboard.
