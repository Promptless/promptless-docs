# Docs Locations

Most often, no matter which hosting provider (Readme, Mintlify, Docusaurus) you use, as long as your docs are sync-ed to github, all you need is to install the Promptless Github App.

We also offer beta support for additional CMS platforms including:
- Zendesk
- Intercom
- Pylon

## Publishing Process

Documentation updates are published according to your platform:

### GitHub-synced Documentation
Changes are submitted as pull requests to your documentation repository

### ReadMe Integration
Changes are published directly to your ReadMe documentation

### Other Platforms
Updates are published directly to your respective platform (Intercom, Zendesk)

Contact us at hello@gopromptless.ai to learn more about using Promptless with these platforms.
