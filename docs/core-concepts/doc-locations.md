# Docs Locations

## Supported Platforms

Most often, no matter which hosting provider (Readme, Mintlify, Docusaurus) you use, as long as your docs are sync-ed to github, all you need is to install the Promptless Github App.

We also offer beta support for additional CMS platforms including:
- Zendesk
- Intercom
- Pylon

## Managing Documentation Structure

Promptless provides several features to help you maintain a well-organized documentation structure:

### File Organization
- **Folder Structure**: Your documentation can be organized in folders to create a logical hierarchy that makes sense for your users.
- **File Movement**: When Promptless creates new documentation files, you can easily move them to different folders directly from the change history page. This helps you maintain your preferred documentation structure as your content grows.

### Best Practices
- Group related documentation files in thematic folders
- Use consistent naming conventions for files and folders
- Maintain a clear hierarchy that makes it easy for users to find information

## Getting Started

To begin using Promptless with your documentation:
1. Ensure your documentation is in a supported platform
2. Install the Promptless Github App if using Github-synced docs
3. Configure your project settings in the Promptless dashboard
