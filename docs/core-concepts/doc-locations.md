# Docs Locations

Most often, no matter which hosting provider (Readme, Mintlify, Docusaurus) you use, as long as your docs are sync-ed to github, all you need is to install the Promptless Github App.

We also offer beta support for additional CMS platforms including:
- Zendesk
- Intercom
- Pylon
- Notion (with database support)

For Notion integration, we support:
- Documentation pages in standard Notion pages and databases
- Automatic syncing of documentation changes from other sources to Notion
- Support for Notion's native page hierarchy and database structures
- Preservation of rich text formatting, code blocks, and embedded content
- Version history tracking through Notion's built-in page history

Contact us at hello@gopromptless.ai to learn more about using Promptless with these platforms.
