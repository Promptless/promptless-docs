# Docs Locations

Most often, no matter which hosting provider (Readme, Mintlify, Docusaurus) you use, as long as your docs are sync-ed to github, all you need is to install the Promptless Github App.

We also offer beta support for additional CMS platforms including:
- Zendesk
- Intercom
- Pylon

## Publishing Process

When publishing documentation updates through Promptless, you'll receive real-time feedback on the status of your changes:

### GitHub-synced Documentation
- Changes are submitted as pull requests
- After successful publishing, you'll see a link to view the PR on GitHub
- Any errors during the process will be clearly displayed

### ReadMe Integration
- Direct publishing to your ReadMe documentation
- Success confirmation when changes are published
- Link to view the updated article on ReadMe
- Clear error messages if publishing fails

### Other Platforms
- Platform-specific success confirmations
- Links to view published content on respective platforms (Intercom, Zendesk)
- Detailed error messages if issues occur during publishing
