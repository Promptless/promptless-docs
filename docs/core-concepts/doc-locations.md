# Docs Locations

Most often, no matter which hosting provider (Readme, Mintlify, Docusaurus) you use, as long as your docs are sync-ed to github, all you need is to install the Promptless Github App.

## Zendesk Integration
Promptless offers native integration with Zendesk Help Center documentation. After connecting your Zendesk account through the Promptless dashboard, you can:
- Automatically update Zendesk Help Center articles
- Create new documentation drafts directly in Zendesk
- Maintain version control and review processes for your Zendesk content

## Additional CMS Support
We also offer beta support for additional CMS platforms including:
- Intercom
- Pylon
