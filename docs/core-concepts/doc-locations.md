# Docs Locations

Most often, no matter which hosting provider (Readme, Mintlify, Docusaurus) you use, as long as your docs are sync-ed to github, all you need is to install the Promptless Github App.

We also support several documentation platforms through direct integration:
- Readme (via API key)
- Intercom Help Center
- Zendesk
- Pylon

Each platform integration is designed to work seamlessly with your existing documentation workflow. For platform-specific setup instructions or to learn about additional platform support, contact us at hello@gopromptless.ai.
