# Docs Locations

Most often, no matter which hosting provider (Readme, Mintlify, Docusaurus) you use, as long as your docs are sync-ed to github, all you need is to install the Promptless Github App.

We also offer beta support for additional CMS platforms including:
- **Intercom**: Help center content management with draft review workflow
- **Webflow**: Blog posts, collection items, and CMS content management

## Webflow CMS Support

Promptless can manage various types of content in Webflow:
- Blog posts and articles
- Collection items (custom content types)
- Static pages and landing pages
- Rich content with images and formatting

This makes it easy to keep your Webflow blog and marketing site content up-to-date automatically.

## Custom CMS Integration

Promptless is flexible and can integrate with any CMS platform that provides an API. If you're using a different CMS and would like to integrate it with Promptless, please contact us at hello@gopromptless.ai to discuss adding support for your CMS platform.
