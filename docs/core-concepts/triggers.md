# Triggers

Triggers are events that tell Promptless that there might be a documentation update that is warranted. Promptless supports multiple trigger types to fit seamlessly into your team's workflow -- it is designed to minimize the friction of creating and updating documentation.

## Supported Triggers

### GitHub Pull Requests

When configured, Promptless automatically runs whenever a new pull request is opened in your specified source repositories. If there are any changes in the PR that might impact the documentation, Promptless will suggest documentation updates. By default, these suggestions will be available in the Promptless dashboard for review. If auto-publish is enabled for your project, Promptless will automatically create a new PR with the suggested documentation changes and link to it in a comment on the original PR. If there are no changes to the documentation, Promptless will leave a comment indicating that no documentation updates were necessary.

During the review process, if you need additional changes or have specific requests for the documentation updates, you can use the follow-on request feature. This allows you to provide additional instructions or feedback to Promptless, which will then process your request and suggest updated changes based on your input.

### Bitbucket Pull Requests

Similar to GitHub, Promptless can be triggered by pull requests in Bitbucket repositories. When a new pull request is opened in your specified Bitbucket repositories, Promptless analyzes the changes and suggests documentation updates if needed. You can configure specific directories to monitor for changes, allowing you to focus documentation efforts on the most relevant parts of your codebase.

The workflow for Bitbucket triggers follows the same pattern as GitHub triggers, with options for auto-publishing and follow-on requests to streamline your documentation process. Promptless will add comments to your Bitbucket pull requests indicating whether documentation updates were necessary, and if so, provide links to review those changes.

Note that Promptless automatically skips draft pull requests in Bitbucket. Documentation updates will only be triggered when the pull request is marked as ready for review.

### Slack Integration

When configured, Promptless can be triggered from Slack channels to find documentation updates that may be warranted from a thread. Primarily, this is used in Slack Connect support channels with customers -- where in a thread, a customer asks a question about your product, your team has answered it, and when Promptless is triggered, it suggests documentation updates based on the content of the thread. This is particularly useful if you notice a common question that you think should be answered in the docs. 

Promptless can be triggered directly from Slack in two ways:

1. **Message Action**: Use the Promptless message shortcut on any Slack message to trigger documentation analysis
2. **Mentions**: Tag Promptless in a channel to request documentation updates

#### Image Processing in Slack Threads

Promptless can now process and incorporate images shared in Slack threads when triggered:

- When you tag @Promptless or use the "Update docs" message action in a thread containing images, Promptless will analyze both the text and images.
- Promptless intelligently evaluates which images provide valuable context for documentation and includes them appropriately.
- Images are securely stored in an S3 bucket managed by Promptless and properly formatted for your documentation platform.

This feature is particularly valuable for:

- **Product Documentation**: Add screenshots of new features directly from announcement threads
- **Troubleshooting Guides**: Include error message screenshots shared during support conversations
- **Tutorials**: Create visual step-by-step guides using screenshots shared in discussion threads
- **User Guides**: Enhance explanations with UI screenshots from customer conversations

For example, if you notify a customer about a new feature in a Slack Connect channel and include screenshots, you can trigger Promptless via the Slack Message Action, and it will automatically incorporate those screenshots into the appropriate documentation sections.

During the review process, you can see and approve the images that Promptless has added to the documentation. After approval, the images become part of your documentation and can be managed through the Promptless dashboard.

This feature requires the latest version of the Slack integration with appropriate permissions. See the [Slack Integration](/integrations/slack) page for more details on setup and image management.

### Intercom Integration

When configured, Promptless monitors your Intercom conversations for potential documentation updates. This integration helps identify common questions or issues that arise in customer conversations, automatically suggesting documentation improvements to better serve your users. Promptless analyzes the conversation content to determine if any documentation updates or additions would be beneficial.

Promptless is automatically triggered in Intercom in two ways:

1. **Conversation Close**: When a conversation with a customer is closed, Promptless analyzes the conversation for potential documentation updates
2. **Note Added**: When a team member adds a note to a conversation, Promptless reviews the context for documentation opportunities

Promptless regularly adds new trigger types. If you need a specific trigger that isn't currently supported, please contact us at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai).
