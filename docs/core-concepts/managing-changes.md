# Managing Documentation Changes

Promptless provides a comprehensive interface for reviewing and managing suggested documentation changes. This guide explains how to effectively use the change history interface to review, approve, or reject documentation updates.

## Change History Interface

The change history interface shows you all documentation changes suggested by Promptless for a particular trigger (such as a GitHub PR or Slack conversation). For each suggested change, you can:

- View the proposed changes in a diff format
- See the context that led to the suggestion
- Approve or reject individual changes
- Manage multiple changes at once

## Reviewing Changes

Each suggested change shows:

1. The file being modified
2. A diff view highlighting:
   - Added content (in green)
   - Removed content (in red)
3. The reasoning behind the suggested change
4. Options to approve or reject the change

## Managing Individual Changes

To manage individual changes:

1. Review the proposed changes in the diff view
2. Click "Approve" to accept the changes
3. Click "Reject" to decline the changes
4. (Optional) Provide feedback about why a change was rejected

## Bulk Actions

To manage multiple changes efficiently, you can:

- **Approve All**: Accept all suggested changes in the current view
- **Reject All**: Decline all suggested changes in the current view

These bulk actions help you manage documentation updates more efficiently, especially when dealing with multiple related changes.
