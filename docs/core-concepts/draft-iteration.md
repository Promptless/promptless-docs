# Draft Iteration

Promptless provides a flexible workflow for reviewing and refining documentation updates before they're published. This iterative approach ensures that automated suggestions can be tailored to match your organization's voice and standards.

## Draft Editor

When Promptless generates a documentation update suggestion, you have access to a full-featured editor where you can:
- Review the suggested changes
- Make direct modifications to the content
- Format text using markdown
- Preview how the changes will look in your documentation
