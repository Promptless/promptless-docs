# Draft Iteration

Promptless provides a flexible workflow for reviewing and refining documentation updates before they're published. This iterative approach ensures that automated suggestions can be tailored to match your organization's voice and standards.

## Draft Editor

When Promptless generates a documentation update suggestion, you have access to a full-featured editor where you can:
- Review the suggested changes
- Make direct modifications to the content
- Format text using markdown
- Preview how the changes will look in your documentation

## Making Changes

### Editing Drafts
You can freely edit any part of the suggested documentation update. Common modifications include:
- Adjusting terminology to match your organization's conventions
- Expanding on technical details
- Restructuring content for better clarity
- Adding additional context or examples

### Reverting Changes
If you're not satisfied with your edits, you can:
- Undo recent changes
- Revert to the original Promptless suggestion
- Start fresh with a new draft

## Finalizing Updates

Once you're satisfied with the documentation changes, you have two options for publishing:

### Opening a Pull Request
- Creates a new PR in your documentation repository
- Allows for team review before merging
- Maintains version control of documentation changes
- Enables additional discussion and refinements

### Direct Publishing
- Updates your documentation location immediately
- Suitable for urgent changes or simple updates
- Available for supported documentation platforms
- Bypasses the PR review process when appropriate

## Best Practices

1. Review all suggested changes carefully
2. Use the preview feature to ensure formatting is correct
3. Consider your team's review process when choosing between PR and direct publishing
4. Maintain consistent terminology across documentation
5. Save drafts periodically during extensive editing sessions
