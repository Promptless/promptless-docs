# Context Sources

Context sources are integrations that connect Promptless to your organization's existing tools and data, enabling it to understand and operate within your company's specific context. By leveraging these integrations, Promptless can generate more relevant and accurate documentation updates that align with your team's terminology, workflows, and existing knowledge base.

## Data Privacy and Storage

Promptless prioritizes your data privacy and security. We do not store any of your organization's data from context sources. Instead, our agents query the relevant APIs in real-time when documentation updates are needed, ensuring that we only access the information required for the specific documentation task at hand.

## Additional Context Sources

Need integration with other tools? Contact [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai) to request additional context sources. We're continuously expanding our integration options to better serve your documentation needs.
