# Context Sources

Context sources are integrations that connect Promptless to your organization's existing tools and data, enabling it to understand and operate within your company's specific context. By leveraging these integrations, Promptless can generate more relevant and accurate documentation updates that align with your team's terminology, workflows, and existing knowledge base.

## Supported Context Sources

Promptless integrates with several key platforms to gather context:
- Project Management Tools (Linear, Jira)
- Communication Platforms (Slack)
- Customer Support Platforms (Intercom)
- Document Storage (Google Drive)

Our Intercom integration is particularly valuable as it provides both context from customer conversations and serves as a documentation platform, allowing for seamless updates to your Help Center content.
