# Context Sources

Context sources are integrations that connect Promptless to your organization's existing tools and data, enabling it to understand and operate within your company's specific context. By leveraging these integrations, Promptless can generate more relevant and accurate documentation updates that align with your team's terminology, workflows, and existing knowledge base.

## Types of Context Sources

Promptless can gather context from various types of tools:
- Project Management Tools: Track feature development and bug fixes
- Communication Platforms: Understand customer interactions and support conversations
- Documentation Systems: Learn from existing documentation and help center content
- Knowledge Bases: Incorporate internal documentation and team resources

The more context sources you connect, the better Promptless becomes at understanding your product and suggesting relevant documentation updates.
