# Context Sources

Context sources are integrations that connect Promptless to your organization's existing tools and data, enabling it to understand and operate within your company's specific context. By leveraging these integrations, Promptless can generate more relevant and accurate documentation updates that align with your team's terminology, workflows, and existing knowledge base.

## Supported Integrations

Promptless integrates with various tools to provide comprehensive context:

- **Notion**: 
  - Extract context from both Notion pages and databases
  - Analyze internal documentation and knowledge base content
  - Understand company-specific terminology from Notion glossaries
  - Process structured data from Notion databases for technical references
  - Support for private and shared Notion workspaces
- **Other Tools**: Integration with project management tools, communication platforms, and knowledge bases

## Data Privacy and Storage

Promptless prioritizes your data privacy and security. We do not store any of your organization's data from context sources. Instead, our agents query the relevant APIs in real-time when documentation updates are needed, ensuring that we only access the information required for the specific documentation task at hand.

## Additional Context Sources
