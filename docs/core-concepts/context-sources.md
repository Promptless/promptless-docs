# Context Sources

Context sources are integrations that connect Promptless to your organization's existing tools and data, enabling it to understand and operate within your company's specific context. By leveraging these integrations, Promptless can generate more relevant and accurate documentation updates that align with your team's terminology, workflows, and existing knowledge base.

## Data Privacy and Storage

Promptless processes context source data in real-time without permanent storage. We only access the information required for specific documentation tasks.

For comprehensive data handling details, see our [Security and Privacy documentation](/security-and-privacy/data-handling).

## Additional Context Sources

Need integration with other tools? Contact [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai) to request additional context sources. We're continuously expanding our integration options to better serve your documentation needs.
