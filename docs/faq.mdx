## Documentation Management

### How can I edit the location of a Promptless suggestion?

When reviewing documentation suggestions in the Promptless dashboard, you can change the location of any suggested file:

2. Click the "move file" option next to the file

This can be particularly useful when Promptless suggests new documentation files and you want to organize them in a different part of your documentation structure.

### How can I add a new file to Promptless suggestions?

When reviewing documentation suggestions in the Promptless dashboard, you can add entirely new files that weren't initially suggested by Promptless:
1. In the suggestion review interface, look for the "Add new file" button
2. Click this button to open the file creation interface
3. Specify the file path and name for your new document
4. Create the content for your new file using the built-in editor
5. Click "Save" to add this file to your current set of documentation changes

This feature is useful when you want to complement Promptless's suggestions with additional documentation files that you know are needed.
