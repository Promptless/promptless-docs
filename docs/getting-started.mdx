# Getting Started

Welcome to Promptless! ðŸŽ‰

Promptless automatically updates your docs, saving your team time and improving your customers' experience with your product.

Before you start, you'll need a Promptless account. If you don't have one yet, contact our team at [hello@gopromptless.ai](mailto:hello@gopromptless.ai) to get one. Once you have an account, you can configure Promptless in just two easy steps: (1) you'll set up integrations to connect Promptless to your triggers, context sources, and docs, and (2) you'll create a project to tell Promptless what to do when it's triggered.

## Step 1: Set up integrations

Once you're signed into the [Promptless dashboard](https://app.gopromptless.ai/), visit the [Integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations). From there, you should set up the following integrations:

* Your triggers (e.g. Github or Slack). You can trigger Promptless from new Github PRs and from the Promptless Slack message action (primarily used in Slack Connect support channels). If you're connecting Github, make sure to give Promptless access to your source code repos that you want Promptless to be triggered from, as well the repo containing your docs.  
* [Optional] Your context sources (e.g. Linear, Jira, Google Drive). You can connect Promptless to your Linear, Jira, Google Drive, or Slack accounts to get context from these sources. The more relevant context you provide, the better Promptless will be at suggesting changes.
* Your docs (typically a Github repo). If your docs are in a directory within a Github repo, you'll be able to set the directory when you create a project. If your docs are hosted by [Readme](https://readme.com/) and are not synced to Github, use the Readme API key integration. 

If you don't see the integration you need, please let us know at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai). Promptless adds new integrations every week. Once you're set up, your Integrations page might look like this:

## Step 2: Create a project

Once you've set up integrations, visit the [Projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Creating a project will let Promptless index your docs and find the right place to sugggest a change. You can set up different types of triggers for different projects:
- Slack: Promptless runs when you tag it or when you use the message shortcut in Slack
- Github: Promptless runs upon opening a PR in any of the source repos you specify in the Project

If you want to have both triggers, create two separate projects with all other information the same. You'll also be able to set up context sources for each project, to instruct Promptless on which Linear Teams, Jira Projects, Google Drive folders, etc to search when generating suggestions. 

A new project for a Github PR trigger might look like this:

<img src="/img/new-project.png" alt="New Project for Github PR Trigger" style={{width:"600px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto", marginBottom: "20px", boxShadow: "0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"}} />

## Step 3: Configure Notification Settings

After creating your project, you'll want to configure how you and your team receive notifications about Promptless suggestions. To set this up:

1. Navigate to the User Settings tab in the Promptless dashboard
2. Look for the "Notification Preferences" section
3. Configure the following settings:

### Slack Notifications
* **Team Channel**: Select a specific Slack channel where Promptless will send all documentation update suggestions
  - This creates a central place for your team to review and discuss suggestions
  - All team members in the channel will be notified of new suggestions
  - Suggestions include direct links to review and approve the changes

### GitHub Notifications
* **PR Comments**: Choose when Promptless should comment on GitHub PRs:
  - When documentation updates are needed (includes links to suggested changes)
  - When no documentation updates are necessary (optional confirmation)
  - Set notification preferences per repository or globally

### Email Notifications
* Configure email notifications as a backup to Slack and GitHub notifications
* Choose notification frequency (immediate, daily digest, or weekly summary)

These notification settings ensure that your team stays informed about documentation update suggestions and can easily review and approve changes. You can modify these settings at any time through the User Settings tab.

And that's it! Promptless will start listening for events on your Projects' triggers, and draft a documentation updates for you to review.
