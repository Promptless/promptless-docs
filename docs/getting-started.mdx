# Getting Started

Welcome to Promptless! 🎉

Promptless automatically updates your docs, saving your team time and improving your customers' experience with your product.

You can get started with Promptless right away by signing up through our dashboard. All new accounts start with a trial period that gives you full access to all features. During your trial, you can configure Promptless in just two easy steps: (1) you'll set up integrations to connect Promptless to your triggers, context sources, and docs, and (2) you'll create a project to tell Promptless what to do when it's triggered.

## Trial Period

When you first sign up, you'll be on a trial period that gives you access to all Promptless features. During your trial:
- You'll see a "TRIAL" badge in your dashboard
- You'll have access to all features and integrations
- You can set up multiple projects and triggers

To continue using Promptless after your trial, you'll need to book a quick discovery call with our team. You can do this directly from the dashboard or by visiting our [booking page](https://cal.com/team/promptless/15m-discovery-call).

## Step 1: Set up integrations

Once you're signed into the [Promptless dashboard](https://app.gopromptless.ai/), visit the [Integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations). From there, you should set up the following integrations:

* Your triggers (e.g. Github or Slack). You can trigger Promptless from new Github PRs and from the Promptless Slack message action (primarily used in Slack Connect support channels). If you're connecting Github, make sure to give Promptless access to your source code repos that you want Promptless to be triggered from, as well the repo containing your docs.  
* [Optional] Your context sources (e.g. Linear, Jira, Google Drive). You can connect Promptless to your Linear, Jira, Google Drive, or Slack accounts to get context from these sources. The more relevant context you provide, the better Promptless will be at suggesting changes.
* Your docs (typically a Github repo). If your docs are in a directory within a Github repo, you'll be able to set the directory when you create a project. If your docs are hosted by [Readme](https://readme.com/) and are not synced to Github, use the Readme API key integration. 

If you don't see the integration you need, please let us know at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai). Promptless adds new integrations every week. Once you're set up, your Integrations page might look like this:

## Step 2: Create a project

Once you've set up integrations, visit the [Projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Creating a project will let Promptless index your docs and find the right place to sugggest a change. You can set up different types of triggers for different projects:
- Slack: Promptless runs when you tag it or when you use the message shortcut in Slack
- Github: Promptless runs upon opening a PR in any of the source repos you specify in the Project

If you want to have both triggers, create two separate projects with all other information the same. You'll also be able to set up context sources for each project, to instruct Promptless on which Linear Teams, Jira Projects, Google Drive folders, etc to search when generating suggestions. 

A new project for a Github PR trigger might look like this:

<img src="/img/new-project.png" alt="New Project for Github PR Trigger" style={{width:"600px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto", marginBottom: "20px", boxShadow: "0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"}} />

## Step 3: Configure Notification Settings

After creating your project, you can configure how you want to be notified about Promptless suggestions. Visit the User Settings tab in the dashboard to set up your notification preferences:

* **Slack Channel Notifications**: Specify a Slack channel where Promptless should send all documentation update suggestions. This helps your team stay informed and review suggestions in one place.
* **GitHub PR Comments**: Configure whether Promptless should leave comments on GitHub PRs when it:
  - Detects that documentation updates are needed
  - Determines that no documentation updates are necessary

These notification settings help ensure that your team never misses a documentation update suggestion from Promptless.

And that's it! Promptless will start listening for events on your Projects' triggers, and draft documentation updates for you to review.
