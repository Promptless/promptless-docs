# Getting Started

Welcome to Promptless! ðŸŽ‰

Promptless automatically updates your docs, saving your team time and improving your customers' experience with your product.

Before you start, you'll need a Promptless account. If you don't have one yet, contact our team at [hello@gopromptless.ai](mailto:hello@gopromptless.ai) to get one. Once you have an account, you can configure Promptless in just two easy steps: (1) you'll set up integrations to connect Promptless to your triggers, context sources, and docs, and (2) you'll create a project to tell Promptless what to do when it's triggered.

## Step 1: Set up integrations

Once you're signed into the [Promptless dashboard](https://app.gopromptless.ai/), visit the [Integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations). From there, you should set up the following integrations:

* Your triggers (e.g. Github or Slack). You can trigger Promptless from new Github PRs and from the Promptless Slack message action (primarily used in Slack Connect support channels). If you're connecting Github, make sure to give Promptless access to your source code repos that you want Promptless to be triggered from, as well the repo containing your docs.  
* [Optional] Your context sources (e.g. Linear, Jira, Google Drive). You can connect Promptless to your Linear, Jira, Google Drive, or Slack accounts to get context from these sources. The more relevant context you provide, the better Promptless will be at suggesting changes.
* Your docs (typically a Github repo). If your docs are in a directory within a Github repo, you'll be able to set the directory when you create a project. If your docs are hosted by [Readme](https://readme.com/) and are not synced to Github, use the Readme API key integration. 

If you don't see the integration you need, please let us know at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai). Promptless adds new integrations every week. Once you're set up, your Integrations page might look like this:

## Step 2: Create a project

{/* ### Steps to Connect Github
1. Go to the Integrations page
2. Youâ€™ll see the following screen. Click Configure.

3. Grant access to promptless on selected repos (source and docs), if they are in the same repo, even simpler!

 */}

Once you've set up integrations, visit the [Projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Creating a project will let Promptless index your docs and find the right place to sugggest a change. You can set up different types of triggers for different projects:
- Slack: Promptless runs when you tag it or when you use the message shortcut in Slack
- Github: Promptless runs upon opening a PR in any of the source repos you specify in the Project

If you want to have both triggers, create two separate projects with all other information the same. You'll also be able to set up context sources for each project, to instruct Promptless on which Linear Teams, Jira Projects, Google Drive folders, etc to search when generating suggestions. 

A new project for a Github PR trigger might look like this:

<img src="/img/new-project.png" alt="New Project for Github PR Trigger" style={{width:"600px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto", marginBottom: "20px", boxShadow: "0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"}} />

## New UI Features

Our dashboard now includes several new features to improve your documentation management experience:

### File Management
- **Open File Button**: Quickly access and edit your documentation files directly from the dashboard
- **Edit File Path**: Easily modify file paths and organize your documentation structure
- **New Docs Chip**: Visual indicator for newly created documentation

### Organization Management
- **Enhanced Organization Controls**: Manage multiple organizations from a single dashboard
- **Team Integration**: Better team information integration with Slack and other services
- **GitHub Integration**: Improved repository management with automatic redirects for organization matching

And that's it! Promptless will start listening for events on your Projects' triggers, and draft documentation updates for you to review.

{/* ### Steps to Create a Project
1. Go to the Projects page, Click on New Project, youâ€™ll see this modal

<img src="/img/create_project.png" alt="Create Project Modal" style={{width:"700px"}} />
2. Give it any name you like. For the trigger, select Github and the source repo name
3. For the docs location, select Github and the docs repo name, or select the same repo as before, but put in the docs directory (eg. docs, no slashes needed)
4. You can select the context source for Promptless from Linear, Jira, Google drive, or Slack */}
