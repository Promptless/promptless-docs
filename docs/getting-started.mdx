# Getting Started

Welcome to Promptless! ðŸŽ‰

Promptless automatically updates your docs, saving your team time and improving your customers' experience with your product.

Before you start, you'll need a Promptless account. If you don't have one yet, contact our team at [hello@gopromptless.ai](mailto:hello@gopromptless.ai) to get one. Once you have an account, you can configure Promptless in three easy steps: (1) set up integrations to connect Promptless to your triggers, context sources, and docs, (2) create a project to tell Promptless what to do when it's triggered, and (3) configure your notification preferences to ensure your team stays informed about documentation updates.

## Step 1: Set up integrations

Once you're signed into the [Promptless dashboard](https://app.gopromptless.ai/), visit the [Integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations). From there, you should set up the following integrations:

* Your triggers (e.g. Github or Slack). You can trigger Promptless from new Github PRs and from the Promptless Slack message action (primarily used in Slack Connect support channels). If you're connecting Github, make sure to give Promptless access to your source code repos that you want Promptless to be triggered from, as well the repo containing your docs.  
* [Optional] Your context sources (e.g. Linear, Jira, Google Drive). You can connect Promptless to your Linear, Jira, Google Drive, or Slack accounts to get context from these sources. The more relevant context you provide, the better Promptless will be at suggesting changes.
* Your docs (typically a Github repo). If your docs are in a directory within a Github repo, you'll be able to set the directory when you create a project. If your docs are hosted by [Readme](https://readme.com/) and are not synced to Github, use the Readme API key integration. 

If you don't see the integration you need, please let us know at [help@gopromptless.ai](mailto:help@gopromptless.ai). Promptless adds new integrations every week. Once you're set up, your Integrations page might look like this:

## Step 2: Create a project

Once you've set up integrations, visit the [Projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Creating a project will let Promptless index your docs and find the right place to sugggest a change. You can set up different types of triggers for different projects:
- Slack: Promptless runs when you tag it or when you use the message shortcut in Slack
- Github: Promptless runs upon opening a PR in any of the source repos you specify in the Project

If you want to have both triggers, create two separate projects with all other information the same. You'll also be able to set up context sources for each project, to instruct Promptless on which Linear Teams, Jira Projects, Google Drive folders, etc to search when generating suggestions. 

A new project for a Github PR trigger might look like this:

<img src="/img/new-project.png" alt="New Project for Github PR Trigger" style={{width:"600px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto", marginBottom: "20px", boxShadow: "0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)"}} />

## Step 3: Configure Notification Settings

After creating your project, it's important to set up your notification preferences to ensure your team stays informed about documentation updates. Visit the User Settings tab in the dashboard to configure how and where you want to receive Promptless notifications.

### Slack Channel Notifications
You can designate a specific Slack channel where Promptless will send all documentation update suggestions. This creates a centralized place for your team to:
* Review all documentation update suggestions
* Track pending documentation changes
* Ensure no suggestions are missed
* Collaborate on documentation reviews

To set this up:
1. Go to User Settings in the Promptless dashboard
2. Select your preferred Slack channel from the dropdown
3. Save your preferences

### GitHub PR Comments
Promptless can automatically comment on GitHub PRs to keep developers informed about documentation needs. You can configure whether Promptless should:
* Leave comments when documentation updates are needed, including:
  - What documentation changes are suggested
  - Which files need to be updated
  - Why the changes are necessary
* Add confirmation comments when no documentation updates are required
* Include links to relevant documentation in the comments

These notification settings help streamline the documentation review process and ensure that your team never misses important documentation updates.

And that's it! Promptless will start listening for events on your Projects' triggers, and draft documentation updates for you to review.
