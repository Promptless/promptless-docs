# Getting Started

Go to Integrations page. For docs sync-ed to Github:

### Install github app on the org, and grant access to the following repos:
- Source repo (where code changes will be made that can serve as the trigger/context for doc changes)
- Doc repo (where documentation files live)

### Steps to Connect Github
1. Go to the Integrations page
2. You’ll see the following screen. Click Configure.

3. Grant access to promptless on selected repos (source and docs), if they are in the same repo, even simpler!

### Create a project 
Creating a project will let Promptless index your docs and find the right place to sugggest a change.
Triggers:
- Slack: Promptless runs when you tag it or when you use the message shortcut in slack
- Github: Promptless runs upon opening a PR in the source repo

If you want to have both triggers, create two separate projects with all other information the same.

### Steps to Create a Project
1. Go to the Projects page, Click on New Project, you’ll see this modal

<img src="/img/create_project.png" alt="Create Project Modal" style={{width:"700px"}} />
2. Give it any name you like. For the trigger, select Github and the source repo name
3. For the docs location, select Github and the docs repo name, or select the same repo as before, but put in the docs directory (eg. docs, no slashes needed)
4. You can select the context source for Promptless from Linear, Jira, Google drive, or Slack
