# Slack Integration

**Used for: Triggers**

Promptless integrates with Slack through our official Slack App, enabling automated documentation updates based on team communication and support conversations.

## Installation

1. Click "Connect Slack" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).

2. You'll be redirected to Slack to install the Promptless app. **Be sure to select the right workspace to install Promptless.**

3. Review and approve the requested permissions for the Promptless Slack app. Promptless requires these permissions to be able to be triggered from the right events in Slack and to notify your team when updates are available.

## Project Setup and Permissions

After installing the Slack app, you can configure new projects in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects) to be set up to trigger from Slack. 

Below is an example of a project that is set up to trigger from Slack.

Once the Project is created, you will be able to trigger Promptless by writing @Promptless in a Slack channel, or by clicking Slack "Update Docs" message action on any thread. When you perform either of these actions, Promptless will pull the entire thread it was tagged in, and idnentify the right documentation updates based on the contents of that thread. 

**Note:** Promptless cannot read threads in private channels that it has not been invited to. 

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses Slack's [official App authentication](https://api.slack.com/authentication), which provides:

- Secure OAuth 2.0 token-based authentication
- Granular permission scopes
- Ability to revoke access at the workspace or channel level
- Regular token rotation for enhanced security
