# Linear Integration

**Used for: Context**

Promptless integrates with Linear through OAuth 2.0, providing secure access to your project management data for documentation automation.

## Project Setup and Permissions

After connecting Linear, you can configure which teams you'd like Promptless to search within when setting up a Project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). Promptless will not be able to search within teams that you do not select. 

For example, in the below example project, Promptless will only search within the `PRO` team for relevant issues.

## Authentication

Promptless uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate with Linear, following Linear's [official OAuth 2.0 specification](https://developers.linear.app/docs/oauth/authentication). This ensures:

- Secure token-based authentication
- Ability to revoke access at any time
- Granular permission control at the team level
- Regular token rotation for enhanced security

You can revoke access at any time through your Linear settings.
