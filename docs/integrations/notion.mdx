# Notion Integration

**Used for: Context**

Promptless integrates with Notion through OAuth 2.0, providing secure access to your Notion workspaces and databases for documentation automation.

## Installation

## Viewing Connected Workspaces and Databases

After connecting Notion, you can view your connected workspaces and their associated databases in the integrations page:

1. Navigate to the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations)
2. Find the Notion integration card
3. You'll see a list of connected workspaces and the databases available within each workspace

This visibility helps you understand which Notion databases Promptless can access when generating documentation.

## Project Setup and Permissions

When setting up a Project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects), you can configure which Notion workspaces and databases Promptless should use as context sources. This allows you to:

- Limit Promptless to specific workspaces relevant to your project
- Ensure documentation is created with the appropriate organizational context
- Maintain data boundaries between different teams or projects

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses OAuth 2.0 to authenticate with Notion, following the [official Notion API authentication guidelines](https://developers.notion.com/docs/authorization). This ensures:

- Secure token-based authentication
- Ability to revoke access at any time
- Workspace-level permission control
- Regular token rotation for enhanced security

## Using Notion as a Context Source

When Promptless is triggered to update documentation, it can use your connected Notion databases as context sources to:

1. Retrieve relevant information about your products, features, or processes
2. Understand your organization's terminology and naming conventions
3. Access structured data that helps create more accurate documentation
4. Align documentation with existing knowledge in your Notion workspace

This integration helps ensure that your documentation remains consistent with your team's knowledge base in Notion.
