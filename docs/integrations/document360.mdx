# Document360 Integration

**Used for: Publishing**

Promptless integrates with Document360 to enable automated documentation updates to your knowledge base.

## Installation

1. Click "Connect Document360" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).

2. Enter your Document360 API token. You can find this in your Document360 account settings under API Access.

3. Verify that Promptless is connected in the integrations page.

## Project Setup

After setting up the integration, you can create a project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). When configuring your project:

1. Select Document360 as your documentation platform
2. Choose which categories and sections you want Promptless to manage
3. Configure your auto-publishing preferences

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses Document360's API token-based authentication system. This ensures:
- Secure access to your knowledge base
- Ability to manage documentation content programmatically
- Full audit trail of all documentation changes
- Easy access revocation if needed

## Security Considerations

- API tokens are encrypted at rest using AES-256
- All API communications use TLS 1.2+
- Tokens can be rotated or revoked at any time through Document360's interface
