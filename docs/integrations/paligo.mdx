# Paligo Integration

**Used for: Publishing**

Promptless integrates with Paligo to enable automated updates to your technical documentation.

## Installation

1. Click "Connect Paligo" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).

2. Enter your Paligo credentials:
   - Username (your Paligo instance name)
   - API key (found in your Paligo settings)

3. Verify that Promptless is connected in the integrations page.

## Project Setup

After setting up the integration, you can create a project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). When configuring your project:

1. Select Paligo as your documentation platform
2. Choose which documentation folders you want Promptless to manage
3. Configure your auto-publishing preferences

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses Paligo's API authentication system, which requires:
- Your Paligo instance username
- A valid API key from your Paligo account

This ensures:
- Secure access to your documentation
- Ability to manage content programmatically
- Full audit trail of all documentation changes
- Easy access revocation if needed

## Security Considerations

- API credentials are encrypted at rest using AES-256
- All API communications use TLS 1.2+
- API keys can be rotated or revoked at any time through Paligo's interface
