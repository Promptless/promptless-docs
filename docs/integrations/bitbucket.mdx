# Bitbucket Integration

**Used for: Triggers and Context**

Promptless integrates with Bitbucket using app passwords, providing secure access to your repositories for documentation automation.

## Setup Process

1. Navigate to the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations) in your Promptless dashboard and click "Connect Bitbucket".

2. You'll need to provide your Bitbucket username and an app password with appropriate permissions. To create an app password:
   - Log in to your Bitbucket account
   - Go to Personal Settings > App passwords
   - Click "Create app password"
   - Give it a name like "Promptless Integration"
   - Select the following permissions:
     - Repositories: Read
     - Pull requests: Read
   - Copy the generated password (you won't be able to see it again)

3. Enter your Bitbucket username and the app password in the Promptless connection form.

4. Select the workspaces and repositories you want to give Promptless access to. You'll see a list of all available repositories across your workspaces.

5. Verify that Promptless is connected in the integrations page.

## Project Setup and Repository Selection

After setting up the integration, you'll be able to create a project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects) that uses Bitbucket as a trigger source.

When creating a project:

1. Select "Bitbucket" as one of your trigger types
2. Choose which repositories should trigger documentation updates
3. Configure your documentation destination (where updates will be published)
4. Set any additional project settings like auto-publishing or follow-on requests

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses Bitbucket's app password authentication method to securely access your repositories. This approach:

- Provides read-only access to your selected repositories
- Allows you to revoke access at any time by deleting the app password in Bitbucket
- Keeps your main account credentials secure
- Enables granular permission control through Bitbucket's app password permission system

## Workspace and Repository Structure

Promptless understands Bitbucket's organizational structure, including:

- Workspaces (the top-level organizational unit)
- Projects (collections of repositories within a workspace)
- Repositories (individual code repositories)

When setting up the integration, you can select repositories from any workspace or project you have access to.

## Security Considerations

- Promptless stores your Bitbucket app password securely using AES-256 encryption
- All communication with Bitbucket APIs uses TLS 1.2+ encryption
- We recommend creating a dedicated app password with minimal permissions for this integration
- You can revoke access at any time by deleting the app password in your Bitbucket settings

## Limitations

- The Bitbucket integration currently supports Bitbucket Cloud. Support for Bitbucket Server (self-hosted) is planned for a future release.
- Promptless requires read access to your repositories to analyze pull requests for potential documentation updates.
