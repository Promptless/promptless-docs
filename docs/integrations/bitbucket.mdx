# Bitbucket Integration

Promptless integrates with Bitbucket through an official Bitbucket Forge app, enabling automated documentation updates triggered by pull requests in your Bitbucket repositories.

## Setup Process

1. Navigate to the Integrations page in your Promptless dashboard
2. Click "Connect" on the Bitbucket integration card
3. Enter your Bitbucket workspace name
4. You'll be redirected to Bitbucket to install the Promptless Forge app
5. Select the repositories you want Promptless to access
6. Confirm the installation

## Repository Access

When setting up the Bitbucket integration, you'll need to grant access to two types of repositories:

1. **Source Repositories**: These are the repositories where Promptless will monitor pull requests for potential documentation impacts. Promptless needs read-only access to these repositories.
2. **Documentation Repositories**: If you store your documentation in Bitbucket, you'll need to grant read-write access to these repositories so Promptless can create documentation update PRs.

## Authentication & Security

The Bitbucket integration uses:
- Bitbucket's Forge app infrastructure for secure authentication
- Repository-specific access controls
- Encrypted data transmission and storage

## Using the Integration

Once connected, you can:
1. Create projects that trigger on Bitbucket pull requests
2. Select specific repositories to monitor for changes
3. Enable auto-publishing of documentation updates
4. Configure notification settings for documentation suggestions

## Workspace-Level Installation

The Bitbucket integration is installed at the workspace level. This means:
- All repositories in the workspace can be accessed (based on your selection during installation)
- Multiple projects can use the same Bitbucket integration
- Repository access can be managed through Bitbucket's app settings

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Bitbucket integration:
1. Verify your workspace name is correct
2. Check repository permissions in Bitbucket's app settings
3. Ensure the Promptless Forge app is properly installed
