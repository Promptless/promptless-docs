# Bitbucket

Promptless integrates with Bitbucket through an official Bitbucket Connect app, enabling automated documentation updates based on your pull request activity.

## Setup Process

1. Navigate to the Integrations page in your Promptless dashboard
2. Click "Connect" next to the Bitbucket integration
3. You'll be redirected to Bitbucket to authorize the Promptless app
4. Select the account where you want to install Promptless
5. Review and approve the requested permissions
6. You'll be redirected back to Promptless to complete the setup

## Required Permissions

The Bitbucket integration requires the following permissions:
- Account: For basic account information
- Repository: To access repository content and pull requests
- Pull Request: To monitor pull request events

## Functionality

Once connected, Promptless will automatically monitor your Bitbucket repositories for:
- New pull requests
- Updates to existing pull requests
- Merged pull requests

When these events occur, Promptless analyzes the changes to determine if documentation updates are needed. If updates are warranted, Promptless will either:
- Create suggestions in your Promptless dashboard for review
- Automatically create documentation updates if auto-publish is enabled for your project

## Security

The Bitbucket integration follows Promptless's security best practices:
- JWT-based authentication
- TLS 1.2+ encryption for data in transit
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- Minimal data retention - only processes pull request data when events occur

## Disconnecting

To disconnect the Bitbucket integration:
1. Go to the Integrations page in your Promptless dashboard
2. Click "Disconnect" next to the Bitbucket integration
3. Confirm the disconnection

You can also uninstall the Promptless app directly from your Bitbucket account settings.
