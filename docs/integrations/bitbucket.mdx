# Bitbucket Integration

Promptless integrates with Bitbucket to automatically update your documentation when code changes are made. This integration allows you to connect your Bitbucket workspace and repositories, monitor pull requests for changes that might require documentation updates, and automate the documentation process.

## Installation

To set up the Bitbucket integration:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page in your Promptless dashboard
2. Click on **Connect** next to the Bitbucket option
3. Enter your Bitbucket credentials:
   - **Username**: Your Bitbucket username
   - **App Password**: A Bitbucket app password with appropriate permissions
   - **Workspace Name**: The name of your Bitbucket workspace

:::tip Creating a Bitbucket App Password
To create an app password with the right permissions:
1. Go to your Bitbucket account settings
2. Navigate to **App passwords** under **Access management**
3. Click **Create app password**
4. Give it a descriptive name like "Promptless Integration"
5. Select the following permissions:
   - **Repositories**: Read
   - **Pull requests**: Read and Write
   - **Webhooks**: Read and Write
:::

## Project Setup

After connecting your Bitbucket account, you can configure how Promptless interacts with your repositories:

### Repository Access

When setting up a project with Bitbucket as a trigger source:

1. Select the repositories you want Promptless to monitor for changes
2. Choose whether Promptless should have read-only access or write access to your documentation repositories
3. Optionally, configure directory-specific triggers to focus on particular parts of your codebase

### Directory-Specific Triggers

Similar to the GitHub integration, you can configure Promptless to only trigger documentation updates when changes are made to specific directories in your Bitbucket repositories. This is useful for:

- Focusing on code that directly impacts user-facing features
- Monitoring API changes that require documentation updates
- Ignoring internal tooling or test changes that don't affect documentation

To set up directory-specific triggers:

1. In your project configuration, select the Bitbucket repository
2. Under **Advanced Options**, enable **Directory-Specific Triggers**
3. Enter the directories you want to monitor, separated by commas (e.g., `src/api, docs/reference`)

## Publishing Workflow

When Promptless creates or updates documentation for your Bitbucket-hosted repositories:

1. Documentation changes are prepared based on your triggers and context sources
2. Review the suggested changes in the Change History page
3. Click **"Save All & Update Bitbucket"** to publish directly to your documentation repository
4. Changes are automatically committed to the specified branch in your Bitbucket repository
5. View the published changes in your Bitbucket repository and documentation site

### Publishing from Change History

The Change History page provides a streamlined publishing experience for Bitbucket repositories:

- **Direct Publishing**: Use the "Save All & Update Bitbucket" button to commit all changes at once
- **Branch Management**: Automatically create pull requests or commit directly to your documentation branch
- **Real-time Updates**: See publishing progress with loading indicators and commit status
- **Success Confirmation**: Receive confirmation when changes are successfully committed to Bitbucket
- **Error Handling**: Get clear error messages if publishing encounters repository access issues

### Auto-Publish Configuration

For streamlined workflows, you can enable auto-publish functionality:

- **Automatic Commits**: Documentation updates are automatically committed to your repository
- **PR Creation**: Optionally create pull requests for documentation changes that require review
- **Branch Strategy**: Configure whether to commit to main branch or create feature branches
- **Commit Messages**: Automatic generation of descriptive commit messages with trigger context

## Authentication Model

The Bitbucket integration uses a username and app password authentication model:

- **Username**: Your Bitbucket username for API authentication
- **App Password**: A secure token with specific permissions for the Promptless integration
- **Workspace Access**: Limited to the specific workspace you connect

This authentication model ensures that Promptless only has access to the repositories and actions you explicitly authorize.

## Repository Refresh

If you add new repositories to your Bitbucket workspace after setting up the integration, you can refresh the repository list:

1. Go to the **Integrations** page in your Promptless dashboard
2. Find the Bitbucket integration
3. Click the **Refresh Repositories** button to update the list of available repositories

## Webhook Management

Promptless automatically sets up webhooks in your Bitbucket repositories to monitor for pull request events. These webhooks:

- Trigger Promptless when pull requests are created or updated
- Send only the necessary information about changes to Promptless
- Can be customized to focus on specific events

## Usage

Once configured, the Bitbucket integration works to automate your documentation workflow:

1. When a pull request is opened or updated in your monitored repositories, Promptless is automatically triggered
2. Promptless analyzes the changes to determine if documentation updates are needed
3. If updates are needed, Promptless generates the appropriate documentation changes
4. Promptless adds a comment to your Bitbucket pull request with a link to review the documentation changes
5. You can review and approve the suggested documentation updates in the Promptless dashboard
6. Use the Change History page to publish approved changes directly to your documentation repository

## Best Practices

- **Review Before Publishing**: Always review documentation changes in the Change History page before publishing
- **Branch Strategy**: Consider using feature branches for documentation updates that require team review
- **Commit History**: Maintain clean commit history with descriptive messages for documentation changes
- **Repository Organization**: Keep documentation repositories well-organized with clear directory structures
