# Bitbucket Integration

Promptless integrates with Bitbucket to automatically update your documentation when code changes occur. This integration allows Promptless to monitor your Bitbucket repositories for pull requests and suggest documentation updates based on the changes.

## Installation

To set up the Bitbucket integration:

1. Navigate to the **Integrations** page in your Promptless dashboard
2. Click on **Connect** next to Bitbucket
3. Enter your Bitbucket username and app password
4. Select the repositories you want to monitor
5. Click **Connect** to complete the setup

During the connection process, Promptless automatically creates the necessary webhooks in your selected Bitbucket repositories. These webhooks are configured to trigger on pull request events (`pullrequest:created` and `pullrequest:updated`), ensuring that Promptless is notified whenever relevant changes occur.

## Authentication

The Bitbucket integration uses username and app password authentication. To create an app password:

1. Log in to your Bitbucket account
2. Go to **Personal settings** > **App passwords**
3. Click **Create app password**
4. Give the app password a name (e.g., "Promptless Integration")
5. Select the following permissions:
   - **Repositories**: Read
   - **Pull requests**: Read
   - **Webhooks**: Read and write
6. Click **Create** and copy the generated password

For enhanced security, we recommend creating a dedicated app password specifically for Promptless with only the necessary permissions.

## Repository Access

When setting up the Bitbucket integration, you'll select which repositories Promptless should monitor. You can choose specific repositories or add all repositories in a workspace.

Promptless requires:
- Read access to your repositories to analyze code changes
- Webhook management permissions to set up automatic triggers

## Webhook Configuration

One of the key advantages of the Bitbucket integration is automatic webhook setup. When you connect your Bitbucket account:

1. Promptless automatically creates webhooks in each selected repository
2. These webhooks are configured to trigger on pull request events
3. The webhook endpoint is securely set to Promptless's API
4. You can view the webhook status for each repository in the integration details

This automatic setup eliminates the need for manual webhook configuration, making the integration process seamless and error-free.

## Project Setup

After connecting Bitbucket, you'll need to create a project in Promptless:

1. Go to the **Projects** page in your Promptless dashboard
2. Click **Create New Project**
3. Select **Bitbucket** as the trigger source
4. Choose which repositories to monitor for this project
5. Configure your documentation repository (where updates will be published)
6. Set your preferences for auto-publishing and notifications
7. Click **Create Project** to save your configuration

## Usage

Once configured, the Bitbucket integration works as follows:

1. When a pull request is created or updated in your monitored repositories, the webhook triggers Promptless
2. Promptless analyzes the changes in the pull request
3. If documentation updates are needed, Promptless generates suggestions
4. Depending on your configuration, Promptless either:
   - Creates a new pull request with the documentation changes
   - Saves the suggestions to your dashboard for review
5. You can review, edit, and approve the suggested documentation changes

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Bitbucket integration:

- **Webhook Failures**: Check the webhook status in your Bitbucket repository settings. Ensure the webhook URL is accessible from Bitbucket's servers.
- **Authentication Issues**: Verify that your app password has the correct permissions and hasn't expired.
- **Missing Triggers**: Confirm that the repositories you want to monitor are selected in both the integration setup and your project configuration.
