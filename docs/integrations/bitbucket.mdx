4. Click "Connect Promptless to Bitbucket" to complete the integration.

## Project Setup and Permissions

After setting up the integration, you'll be able to create a project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). When creating a project, you'll be able to select trigger repositories and documentation repositories from your connected Bitbucket account.

Similar to the GitHub integration, Promptless will have read-only access to the repositories that you select as trigger repositories, and will have write access to the repositories that you select as documentation repositories.

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses Bitbucket's App password authentication method to securely connect to your Bitbucket account. This approach allows:

- Repository-specific access control
- Granular permission settings
- The ability to revoke access at any time by deleting the App password in your Bitbucket account

App passwords provide a secure way for applications like Promptless to access your Bitbucket account without requiring your primary account credentials. [Learn more about App passwords](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/app-passwords/).
