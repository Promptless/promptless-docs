# Bitbucket Integration

**Used for: Triggers and Publishing**

Promptless integrates with Bitbucket through our official Bitbucket Connect app, providing secure access to your repositories for documentation automation.

## Installation

1. Click "Connect Bitbucket" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).

2. Select your Bitbucket workspace where you want to install Promptless.

3. Authorize Promptless to access your Bitbucket workspace.

4. Verify that Promptless is connected in the integrations page.

## Project Setup and Permissions

After setting up the integration, you'll be able to create a project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). When creating a project, you'll be able to select trigger repositories and documentation repositories. Promptless will have read-only access to the repositories that you select as trigger repositories, and will have write access to the repositories that you select as documentation repositories.

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses the official [Bitbucket Connect app specification](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/bitbucket/connect-apps/) to authenticate with Bitbucket. The integration uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and authorization.

This ensures that:
- Promptless has appropriate read and write access to your selected repositories
- Access can be revoked at any time through your Bitbucket workspace settings
- All interactions are authenticated and logged for security purposes
