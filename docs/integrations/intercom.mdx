## Publishing Updates to Intercom

When you're ready to publish documentation updates to Intercom:

2. Click the "Save All & Update Intercom" button
3. Promptless will create or update drafts in your Intercom help center
4. Review and publish the drafts in Intercom when ready

## Limitations

As this is a beta feature:
- Some advanced Intercom formatting options might not be fully supported
- Changes are always created as drafts for review
- Custom HTML and complex layouts should be verified in Intercom before publishing
