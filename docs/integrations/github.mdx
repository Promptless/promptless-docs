# Github Integration

**Used for: Triggers, Context, and Publishing**

Promptless integrates with Github through our official Github App, providing secure access to your repositories for documentation automation.

## Installation

1. Click "Connect Github" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).

3. Select which repositories you want to give Promptless access to. Typically, this will be your source code and your documentation repo (if your docs are in Github).

## Managing Repository Access After Installation

After the initial installation, you may need to add new repositories or modify which repositories Promptless can access. You can manage this directly through your GitHub organization settings:

1. Navigate to your GitHub organization settings
2. Go to "Third-party Access" → "GitHub Apps" 
3. Find "Promptless" in the list and click "Configure"
4. In the "Repository access" section, you can:
   - Switch between "All repositories" and "Only select repositories"
   - Add or remove specific repositories using the "Select repositories" dropdown
   - Remove repositories by clicking the "×" next to their names

5. Click "Save" to apply your changes

After updating repository access, the new repositories will be available when creating or editing projects in Promptless. Note that it may take a few minutes for the changes to be reflected in the Promptless dashboard. If you don't see newly added repositories immediately, you may need to click the "refresh repos" icon in the integrations page to update the repository list.

## Project Setup and Permissions

After setting up the integration, you'll be able to create a project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). When creating a project, you'll be able to select trigger repositories and documentation repositories. Promptless will have read-only access to the repositories that you select as trigger repositories, and will have write access to the repositories that you select as documentation repositories. 

For example, in the below example, Promptless is only able to read the `promptless` and `promptless-dashboard` repos, but is able to read and write to the `promptless-docs` repo.

## Trigger Events in Pull Request Descriptions

When Promptless creates a pull request for documentation updates, it automatically includes a list of the trigger events that led to those changes in the PR description. This provides valuable context for reviewers and creates clear traceability between documentation updates and their originating events.

The trigger events section in the PR description includes:
- Links back to the original source (e.g., Slack threads, GitHub PRs, support tickets)
- Brief descriptions of what triggered the documentation update
- Easy navigation to review the context that prompted the changes

This feature helps you understand why documentation changes were made and provides a clear audit trail for all updates.

## Directory-Specific Triggers

You can configure Promptless to only trigger when changes are made to specific directories within your repositories. This is particularly useful when you want to focus documentation updates on changes to certain parts of your codebase, such as changelog directories.

To set up directory-specific triggers:

1. When creating or editing a project, select the GitHub trigger option
2. Check the "Choose specific directories to trigger this project" option
3. Enter the directory paths you want to monitor, separating multiple paths with commas
4. Save your project configuration

<img src="https://promptless-customer-doc-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs-images/org_2lvkgU9erOFxYhtEVVC0ymPrPdF/47a14116-12d1-4a1d-beae-875c1d182124-github-directory-trigger.png" alt="Directory-specific GitHub trigger configuration" style={{width:"800px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto", boxShadow: "0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", marginBottom: "20px"}} />

Once configured, your specified trigger directories will be visible in the project list view, making it easy to see which directories are being monitored for each project.

<img src="https://promptless-customer-doc-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/docs-images/trigger-directories-display.png" alt="Trigger directories displayed in project list" style={{width:"800px", display: "block", margin: "0 auto", boxShadow: "0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)", marginBottom: "20px"}} />

When trigger directories are specified, only PRs that contain changes to those directories will be considered, and updates to other files will be ignored. 

## Authentication

Promptless uses the official [GitHub App specification](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps) with JWT-based authentication. You can revoke access at any time through your GitHub organization settings.
