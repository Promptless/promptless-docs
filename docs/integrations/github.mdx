- **App-based integration**: Official GitHub App with defined permission scopes
- **Revocable access**: Easily manage or revoke Promptless's access through GitHub
- **Audit logs**: All actions are logged and traceable

## Configuration

In your Promptless project settings, you can:
1. Select source repositories for monitoring
2. Specify target documentation repositories
3. Configure PR-based triggers
