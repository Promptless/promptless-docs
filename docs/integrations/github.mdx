# Github Integration

**Used for: Triggers, Context, and Publishing**

Promptless integrates with Github through our official Github App, providing secure access to your repositories for documentation automation.

## Installation

1. Click "Connect Github" from the [integrations page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/integrations).

3. Select which repositories you want to give Promptless access to. Typically, this will be your source code and your documentation repo (if your docs are in Github). You can also configure Promptless to only trigger on changes in specific directories within your trigger repos.

## Project Setup and Permissions

After setting up the integration, you'll be able to create a project in the [projects page](https://app.gopromptless.ai/projects). When creating a project, you'll be able to select trigger repositories and documentation repositories. Promptless will have read-only access to the repositories that you select as trigger repositories, and will have write access to the repositories that you select as documentation repositories. 

For example, in the below example, Promptless is only able to read the `promptless` and `promptless-dashboard` repos, but is able to read and write to the `promptless-docs` repo.

## Authentication Model

Promptless uses the official [Github App specification](https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/about-creating-github-apps) to authenticate with Github. Promptless authenticates securely with JWTs generated by the Github App installation. 

This ensures that Promptless has read and write access to the repositories that you select, and that either you or Promptless can revoke access at any time.
